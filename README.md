A python program that reads an undirected graph, represented as pairs of node/vertex
names, one pair for each edge. It then will identify the connected components
and, for each component, whether it is acyclic or not. It prints each connected component as a
list of node names (without repeating), along with an indication of whether it contains a cycle.

After running the code with python, it will prompt the user for a filename to import.
